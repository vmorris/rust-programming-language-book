Solutions and exercises for the Rust Programming Language Book

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

~I am following the "experimental" version at https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/~

Update: I switched to using the official book in chapter 4.
I still plan to use the quizes on the exerimental site, but I found the official book had different text.
